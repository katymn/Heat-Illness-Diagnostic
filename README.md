# HeatIllnessDiagnostic
 
Hello!

My "Heat Illness Diagnostic" project was created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS as a front-end website. I also integrated Youtube API. My main focus was creating responsive, clean code.

The motivation of this project was to create an easy tool for nursing and medical students to study heat illnesses and study how to diagnose them.

Future plans include integrating OpenAI API to provide a chatbot for potential study questions. 

Future projects include a patient charting website with OpenAI API integration to summarize charts.

Please let me know how I can improve website accessibility or other improvements I can make!
